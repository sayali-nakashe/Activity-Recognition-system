# Activity-Recognition-system
A multisensor data fusion system

In this project , We have studied various methods for classification of data on the time series dataset.  

The methods are listed below: 
1) Binary Classifiation using Logistic Regression  
2) Binary Classifiation using L-1 penalized Logistic Regression  
3) Multi-class Classifiation using Multinomial Logistic Regression  
4) Multi-class Classifiation using Multinomial Naive Bayes  
5) Multi-class Classifiation using Gaussian Naive Bayes  

In this problem, we classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network. 
The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. In each folder, there are multiple files each of which represents an instant of a human performing an activity. Each file containis 6 time series collected from activities of the same person, which are called avg rss12, var rss12, avg rss13, var rss13, vg rss23, and ar rss23. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which contains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.

Feature engineering and Extraction is used in this project and the various machine learning models are analysed and compared.
